# The Programmable Mind Knowledge Modules for Webpack

This module is the same as <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/tpmkms'>The Programmable Mind Knowledge Modules</a> module but it works with webpack without requiring polyfills. The code that was removed never ran in a browser but caused webpack to want polyfills.
