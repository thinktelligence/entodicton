# The Programmable Mind Knowledge Modules

This is a library of the programmable mind knowledge modules that can be reused. A description of the contents can be found <a href='http://thinktelligence.com/kms'>here</a>

## Knowledge Modules

The list of knowledge modules can be found <a href='http://thinktelligence.com/kms'>here</a>

## Usage

The basic usage is redefine the api functions to point to your data. Then all of the queries that are supported can be performed against your data. Here is an example of how to do that

The first step is to include the client and the knowledge module project called EKMS
```
const { reports } = require('ekms')
```

`reports` is the knowledge module for making repots off data. By default the km will work with test data. You can run it the same as any other Entodicton config. For example, this works against the shared server

```
reports.process('list the products').then( (response) => {
  console.log(response.generated[0])
})
```

The result of running this would be

```
dev@devlaptop:~/code/thinktelligence/kms$ node use_reports.js
[ 'the products are pants1 and shirt1' ]

```

In order to customize the output to your domain you would need to redefine the api to access your data

```
const testData = {
  types: [ 'tanks', 'planes' ],
  products: [
    { marker: 'product', isInstance: true, type: 'tanks', name: 'Tamiya Tiger', cost: 9, id: 1 },
    { marker: 'product', isInstance: true, type: 'planes', name: 'Meng P-47', cost: 15, id: 2 },
  ]
}

const api = {
  getTypes: () => testData.types,
  getAllProducts: () => testData.products,
  getByTypeAndCost: ({type, cost, comparison}) => {
      results = []
      testData.forEach( (product) => {
      if (product.type == type && comparison(product.cost)) {
        results.append(product)
      }
    })
    return results
  },
  productGenerator: [({context}) => context.marker == 'product' && context.isInstance, ({g, context}) => `${context.name}`]
};

reports.api = api

reports.process('list the products').then( (response) => {
  console.log(response.generated[0])
})

```

After doing this the results of running would be

```
dev@devlaptop:~/code/thinktelligence/kms$ node use_store.js
[ 'the products are Tamiya Tiger and Meng P-47' ]
```
